# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis

This project explores patterns in flight delays using a sample dataset of flights between major U.S. airports. It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization with **Python**.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Identify trends in flight delays by **airline** and **time of day**
- Practice **data wrangling** and **date-time analysis**
- Create clear and informative **visualizations**
- Derive **actionable insights** from real-world-style aviation data

---

## 📂 Dataset

- `flights_sample.csv` – A realistic sample dataset (~750 rows) with fields like:
  - Flight Date
  - Airline
  - Origin & Destination
  - Scheduled Departure Time
  - Delay Minutes
  - Cancellation Status

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` – data cleaning & manipulation  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – data visualization  
- `datetime` – time-based feature extraction

---

## 📊 Key Visuals

- **Average departure delay by airline** (bar chart)
- **Delay trend across the day** (line chart)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Some airlines consistently experience higher average delays.
- Departure delays tend to increase at certain times of day.
- Further analysis could include seasonal trends or airport-specific delays.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download `flights_sample.csv` and `flight_delay_analysis.py`
2. Run the script in your Python environment (Jupyter, VS Code, etc.)
3. Visualizations will appear inline or in new windows depending on your setup
